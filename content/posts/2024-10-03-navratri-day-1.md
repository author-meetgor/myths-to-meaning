Navratri is not just about honoring the power of women, but also on purifying oneself from evil within and liberating it with various forms of art. Some rejoicce in dancing, called Garba which is famous in India and is the term used synonymously with Navratri. Where there is dance, there will be music. The atmosphere in these nine days for a person living in India and enjoying him/herself is truly positive and liberating.

For me, I am starting to write this which makes me appreciate and be grateful for this divine atmosphere. This year is one of the years, where I want to liberate from my negative thoughts and move above my senses to embrace a more spiritual existence.

The most personal nostalgia for me growing up is my mother doing prayers and reciting divine aarti of Maa Durga every day for 9 days on the eve of Navratri. It has a special place in my heart, it is a beautiful moment to be living with.

The first day is worshiped to Maa Shailputri, which is the daughter of mountain King Himavat.

## Quote for Day 1

> "Where there is a woman, there is magic."
> 
> — Ntozake Shange

The festival of Navratri has made so many impacts on lives of people, some memories, relations, employments, skills, arts, fame, culture, literature, so much more. It is no doubt to say, where there is a women, there is indeed magic and love. Without her, there is no life. There is no place for a person in this world who disrespects a women.

Also, navratri brings in a new hope, a hope in the dark nights, it is a testament to one’s faith, one’s grit to defeat the evil within, because the fight within is more fierce than the fight outside in this modern world.

With the dawn of each new beginning, may you find the strength to rise, just as the lotus blooms from the depths of the mud.

## Maa Shailputri

As per the Hindu legends, Shailputri was the incarnation of Devi Sati. In this avatar, she took birth as the daughter of King Himavat, the king of the mountains. Hence, the name Shailputri; where *Shaila means Mountain and Putri means daughter. Maa Shailaputri meaning, The Goddess Mountain Daughter.*

![THe goddess of mountains, The mount of the goddess Shailputri is a bull and that is why she is also known as Vrisharudha. The goddess Shailputri is represented with both hands. She carries Trishul in her right hand and the lotus flower in her left hand.](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcd20d1f8-3bef-4c69-9f8b-b9a85c6dfec0_1024x1024.jpeg)

Maa Shailputri is often portrayed riding a magnificent bull (Vrisha), which symbolizes strength, resilience, and the power to overcome obstacles. In this context, the bull reflects her guidance, leading her devotees towards spiritual awakening while embodying her mastery over the material realm.

In her right hand, she wields a trident, or Trishul, symbolizing the divine trinity of Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva. This trident signifies the Goddess’s ability to create, sustain, and destroy, highlighting her as the ultimate representation of divine feminine energy.

She carries a lotus flower in her left hand, which symbolizes purity and peace. symbolizes the power to rise above the material realm, embodying spiritual awakening and purity. It reflects her ability to guide her devotees towards inner peace, harmony, and enlightenment, representing the transformative journey of the soul.

### Muladhara Chakraa

As the first of the Navdurgas, Goddess Shailputri holds a place of immense importance. She is considered the very essence of nature and represents the root chakra (Muladhara), which governs the foundation of human life. 

> मूल: (Mula): → Root
> 
> आधार (Aadhar) → Foundation, Base

It is associated as a base/root chakra because it is the first chakra or the body part which is developed in the womb of a human being. So it is the first form of the new life that will evolve into a complete human being.

From a Yogic perspective, the first day of Navratri is seen as highly auspicious, marking the beginning of the spiritual journey for devoted seekers. On this day, many devotees engage in meditation, chant mantras, and perform specific rituals to honor Maa Shailputri, seeking her blessings for Siddhis and various boons.

As the embodiment of Muladhara Shakti, Goddess Shailputri imparts essential life lessons, awakening individuals to the power of self-awareness and consciousness. The Muladhara Chakra serves as the foundation of our bodily awareness. By focusing one’s energies on this chakra, they can unify their essence with Shakti, elevate their awareness of the higher self, and progress on their spiritual path.

The experience of connecting with Shailputri Mata is profoundly divine, offering an opportunity for soul-searching and spiritual growth. When awakened, she initiates her ascent towards Shiva, who resides in the Crown Chakra (Sahasrara Chakra). This journey represents the beginning of spiritual awakening and the pursuit of one’s life purpose. Without energizing the Muladhara Chakra, individuals may struggle to confront life's challenges. Therefore, during the first day of Navratri, one must concentrate their minds on the Muladhara Chakra, marking the initiation of their spiritual discipline. This day serves as a vital connection to the Divine Mother Durga and the stabilizing energy of the Muladhara Chakra, fostering strength and resilience.
