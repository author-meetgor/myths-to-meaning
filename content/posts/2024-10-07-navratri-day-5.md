## Navratri Day 5

Moving on to the middle day of Navratri, this is the middle night, there were 4 nights past this and there will be 4 more nights after this night. Congratulations, if you have reached here, it is a sign you are removing yourself from evil thoughts and trying to become an enlightened soul. The word “trying” is important because, we might fail as well, and evil might knock back, but we have learned detachment, self-confidence, and self-love in the past days as a teaching and the principle of each day in the form of goddess Maa Durga. Continue with the journey, I am too, I have hope, I have faith, and you should too, It will be beautiful!

The fifth day is about purification, it is about being as pure as the intentions of a mother, we can’t be pure as a mother, but even if we can get close to that, a percentage of pure love of mothers is beautiful enough to be able to see in the world.

It is about realizing that your current situation is the product of your previous karma(punyas). If you have done good deeds in the past life, you will no doubt have a great life. This connection with this fifth day is made by Mother Skandmata with her son Skanda (another name for Kartikeya), a mother nurtures her son no matter who she/he is, a son or a daughter is beautiful for the mother because she has kept him/her in her womb for months, then she has had sleepless nights, busy days, to take care of him/her. She has naturally accepted it as her child, she has to nurture and feed him/her with good thoughts and character, and no matter what she has done in the past, she has to bear it.

Likewise, we as humans have to understand what we have done in the past is our won deeds, we have to accept it and move ahead creating those beautiful moments along the way, that we can learn from Maa Skandmata how to have a heart of a mother, even a percent of her unconditional love in us can help us get out of our sufferings.

As we have rightly learned in the previous day, in the Heart chakra, we have to first love ourselves, we have to heal our thoughts and accept that there are evil things and thoughts within us, it is not wrong, it might be for a reason, we have to accept it. We need to love ourselves however bad we are, if we are bad, we have to accept that.

So, on this day, let’s learn from Mata Skandmata how to pour selfless and unconditional love towards self and others.

### Quote for day 5

> **"A mother is she who can take the place of all others but whose place no one else can take."**
> 
> — Cardinal Mermillod

This quote essentially sums up the day’s message, it is a feeling only mothers can feel, only their children can experience, rest cannot understand the meaning of a true mother-child relationship. That’s why I said, that even coming close to a mother’s love is truly beautiful, if you can have the heart of the mother, there is no more beautiful feeling than that.

## Maa Skandmata Devi

The 5th day of Navratri is dedicated to Goddess Skandamata, the fifth manifestation of Goddess Durga and the revered mother of Lord Kartikeya, who was appointed as the commander-in-chief by the devatas in their battle against demons.

> Skandmata
> 
> * Skanda → Another name for Kartikeya (Son of Parvati and Shiva)
>     
> * Mata → Mother
>     
> 
> Mother of Kartikeya (Skanda)

Maa Skandmata beautifully portrays the deep bond between mother and son, symbolizing love and protection.

As we honor Maa Skandamata, we recognize that our current circumstances are shaped by our past actions, and like a mother, she nurtures us through our journeys. Her divine presence inspires us to embrace love and compassion in our lives, fostering a spirit of purity and kindness.

### Mythological Story

Following Sati's self-immolation, Shiva retreated into intense meditation, disconnecting from the world. Meanwhile, demons Surapadman and Tarakasura, blessed with invincibility, wreaked havoc. The gods, anxious about Shiva's absence, sought Lord Vishnu's guidance. Vishnu attributed the crisis to their own mistake of excluding Shiva and Sati from Daksha Prajapati's Yajna, leading to Sati's demise and Shiva's isolation.

Narad Muniji intervened, informing Parvati, Sati's reincarnation and daughter of the mountain god, that she could reunite with Shiva through severe penance. Driven by love, Parvati undertook thousands of years of intense tapasya, ultimately winning Shiva's heart. The two married, paving the way for the birth of their son.

From their union, a radiant seed was conceived. The seed born from Shiva and Parvati's union was exceptionally radiant, and Lord Agni was entrusted with its care. However, the seed's intense energy overwhelmed Agni, prompting him to seek Ganga's assistance. Ganga nurtured the seed temporarily, until Parvati, recognizing her essence within it, transformed into water to cradle and nourish the seed herself, ensuring its safe gestation. Parvati took the form of water to nurture this seed, resulting in the birth of Kartikeya, who was cared for by the Krittikas. Thus, Kartikeya was born from the "Yog Agni" of Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati.

### Divine Qualities

Maa Skandmata has four hands, she carries lotus in two hands, with one hand she is holding her son Skanda seated in her lap, and with one hand she is in a blessing hand as Abhaya mudra. She is seated on a lion, showing the loyal and fierce form of Mother.

With four arms, three eyes, and a radiant complexion, She is also known as Padamasani, often depicted seated on a lotus flower.

* **Four Arms:** Her four arms represent her multifaceted abilities, demonstrating her strength and grace in nurturing her son and protecting her devotees.
    
* **Lotus:** In her hand, she holds a lotus, symbolizing purity, spiritual awakening, and the beauty of life, reminding us of the importance of inner growth.
    
* **Infant Skanda:** The depiction of her holding the infant Skanda emphasizes her nurturing qualities, showcasing the deep love a mother has for her child and her role in guiding them on their journey.
    
* **Lion**: Shows the loyalty of actions. A lion only feeds on other animals when he is hungry and not for his desires, he then leaves the hunted animal for other animals to feed when his hunger is satisfied. This shows the nature of the mother.
    

Devotees who worship her experience immense affection and fulfillment of their desires, achieving profound joy even in their earthly lives. Her motherly form also inherently honors Lord Kartikeya in his infant form. Maa Skandamata is associated with the Vishuddhi Chakra, representing creativity and communication, further enhancing the spiritual connection with her blessings.

### Vishuddhi / Throat Chakra

The Vishuddhi Chakra, also known as the Throat Chakra, embodies the principles of purification and communication. Located near the larynx, it represents both physical and spiritual cleansing. A significant myth illustrates its power: during the churning of the ocean for the nectar of immortality (Amrita), a deadly poison emerged. To protect the world, Lord Shiva consumed the poison but held it in his throat, transforming it through purification techniques. This act symbolically teaches that negative thoughts and qualities (the poison) must be acknowledged and purified rather than ignored or expressed harmfully.

This chakra governs our ability to express thoughts and emotions, emphasizing the importance of thoughtful communication. Blockages in the Vishuddhi Chakra can lead to physical and emotional ailments, underscoring the need for detoxification on multiple levels—both environmental and personal.

To balance and develop this Chakra one must become lighter, as in removing his/her beliefs, pride, ego, entitlements, and fame, to experience the infinite version of yourself. You need to detach from the image of your current self, as a human, beyond the five senses, beyond this body, there is your soul with infinite powers to move to the divine consciousness.

This is critical in moving on to the next chakra of the Third Eye (Ajana) Chakra which is about divine wisdom/intuition and discrimination of the things beyond the materialistic world.

### Lessons to learn

* Maa Skandamata teaches us the essence of selfless, unconditional love, encouraging us to nurture those around us with compassion.
    
* Acknowledge and accept our past deeds, understanding that they shape our present and guide our growth.
    
* The goddess exemplifies the strength of a mother, showing that true power lies in nurturing and supporting others while maintaining inner resilience.
    
* Removal of all the emotions associated with us, our ego, our pride, our fame, our jealousy, hatred, competition, and other things that show us as a limited being, instead of the infinite form of our soul.

## Conclusion

As we wrap up the learning from day five, which is the midpoint of the auspicious Navratri festival, we continue to wrap ourselves in positive energy. We learned that we need to accept our current condition and nurture our karma today in such a way as it is our child, we have to pour selfless and unconditional love, without caring for the fruits it will bear, we have to make it better as it is our responsibility, moreover, it should be out of love and not responsibility.

In the upcoming days, we will explore more about each form of the goddess Shakti. We will delve into the powers and significance of each day in this festival.

Let’s enjoy the beautiful festival with the buzzing and divine energy around. Let’s remove negativity and spread positivity among us, and then the people around us. Let’s celebrate spiritual empowerment with a whole heart in the atmosphere buzzing with dance and music.
