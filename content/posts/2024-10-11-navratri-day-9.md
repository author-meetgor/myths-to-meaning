## Navratri Day 9

It is finally day 9, the end of Navratri, the end of dark nights, but if used wisely those dark times pave the way for a beautiful and successful morning as Dusherra, the end of evil.

The ninth day of Navratri is dedicated to worshipping Maa Siddhidatri, the embodiment of mastery and spiritual perfection. This day invites us to acknowledge the immense power within us, waiting to be rediscovered. Maa Siddhidatri, the goddess who bestowed the eight siddhis upon Lord Shiva, reminds us that true strength comes from within and is accessed through self-realization and devotion.

On this day, we reflect on the significance of balance between the divine feminine and masculine energies, represented in the form of Ardhanareshwar. By embracing both aspects, we cultivate harmony in our lives, allowing us to rise above challenges and transcend limitations. Maa Siddhidatri's blessings inspire us to pursue mastery over our thoughts and actions, guiding us toward a higher purpose.

Today, as we honor Maa Siddhidatri, we are reminded of the importance of inner transformation. Just as she represents the culmination of spiritual powers, we too can embark on a journey of self-discovery and empowerment. This day encourages us to let go of doubts and fears and embrace our innate potential for greatness. Through her divine grace, we can tap into the siddhis that reside within, enabling us to manifest our dreams and aspirations.

### Quote for day 9

> “You cannot believe in God until you believe in yourself”
> 
> — Swami Vivekananda

To have faith in God, we first need to believe in our thoughts, ourselves, not the materialistic “Me,” but the spiritual “Me.” When we recognize our inner strength and divine potential, we open the door to a deeper connection with the divine. This journey of self-belief allows us to transcend limitations and embrace our true purpose. Just as Maa Siddhidatri embodies mastery and spiritual perfection, may we cultivate the same mastery within ourselves, allowing our faith to illuminate our paths and guide us toward fulfillment and harmony.

In connecting with Maa Siddhidatri, we find the courage to shed the layers of ignorance and ego that cloud our true selves. Her energy inspires us to strive for spiritual growth, reminding us that the path to mastery is a journey of dedication, humility, and unwavering faith. As we celebrate this day, let us commit to realizing the divine potential within us, paving the way for a life filled with love, light, and transformation.

## Maa Siddhidatri

Maa Siddhidatri, the ninth form of the goddess Durga, is revered on the ninth day of Navratri. Her name signifies "the one who bestows mastery," symbolizing her divine power to grant spiritual accomplishments and siddhis.

As the final form of Mahadevi, Maa Siddhidatri represents the culmination of spiritual journey and self-realization.

By bestowing the eight siddhis upon Lord Shiva, she illustrates the potential within each of us to transcend limitations and achieve our highest selves.

Maa Siddhidatri instills a sense of empowerment and determination, reminding us that true mastery comes from within. Through devotion and self-discovery, we can tap into the boundless energy of the universe, guided by her grace on our journey toward spiritual enlightenment.

### Mythological Story

According to mythology, Maa Siddhidatri is revered as the divine embodiment of supernatural powers. At the beginning of time, the universe was a vast void, shrouded in darkness. From this emptiness, Maa Kushmanda emerged, using her radiant smile to create the cosmos and the holy trinity of gods: Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva. Each god was assigned a vital role—Brahma as the creator, Vishnu as the preserver, and Shiva as the destroyer.

However, Lord Shiva sought even greater perfection and deeper blessings from Maa Kushmanda. In response to his devotion, she manifested Maa Siddhidatri, the goddess who bestows mastery over the eight Siddhis (supernatural powers). These powers include Anima (the ability to shrink), Mahima (the ability to expand), Garima (the ability to become heavy), and Laghima (the ability to become light), among others.

1. **Anima**: Ability to become as small as an atom.
    
2. **Mahima**: Ability to become infinitely large.
    
3. **Garima**: The ability to become infinitely heavy.
    
4. **Laghima**: Ability to become very light, enabling levitation.
    
5. **Prapti**: Ability to obtain anything desired, regardless of distance.
    
6. **Prakamya**: Ability to realize all desires.
    
7. **Ishita**: Ability to control natural forces.
    
8. **Vashita**: Ability to control others and influence their minds.
    

Maa Siddhidatri not only blessed Shiva with these eight Siddhis but also gifted him with eighteen perfections in total, which elevated him to the form of Ardhanareshwar—half male, half female, symbolizing the union of Shiva and Shakti. This profound transformation emphasized the balance of divine energies in the universe.

1. **Anurmimattvam**: Undisturbed by Bodily Needs - The ability to remain unaffected by hunger, thirst, and other physical desires.
    
2. **Durasravaṇa**: Hearing from Afar - The power to hear sounds or conversations from great distances, enhancing auditory perception.
    
3. **Duradarsanam**: Seeing from Afar - The ability to see things happening far away, providing insight into distant events.
    
4. **Manojavah**: Movement by Thought - The capability to instantly move one's body wherever one thinks, akin to teleportation or astral travel.
    
5. **Kamarupam**: Assuming Any Form - The power to take on any shape or appearance desired, showing mastery over one's identity.
    
6. **Parakaya Pravesanam**: Entering Other Bodies - The ability to enter and experience life through the body of another person, enhancing empathy and understanding.
    
7. **Svachanda Mrtyuh**: Choosing Death - The power to decide the time of one’s own death, reflecting control over life and mortality.
    
8. **Devanam Saha Krida Anudarsanam**: Witnessing Divine Play - The ability to see and participate in the activities of the gods, connecting with higher spiritual realms.
    
9. **Yatha Sankalpa Samsiddh**: Perfect Fulfillment of Intentions - The capacity to realize one’s thoughts and desires perfectly, aligning will and action.
    
10. **Ajnaprathata Gatih**: Unimpeded Commands - The ability for one's wishes or commands to be carried out without obstacles, demonstrating influence over circumstances.
    

## Ashta Siddhi

#### **Anima**

Ability to reduce one's body to the size of an atom.

Hanuman utilized Anima when he entered the city of Lanka unnoticed. By assuming a minuscule form, he could scout Ravana’s territory and gather vital information, illustrating the power of stealth and subtlety in achieving one's goals.

#### **Mahima**

Ability to expand one's body to an infinite size.

When confronted by the demon Sursa while crossing the ocean, Hanuman invoked Mahima, enlarging himself significantly. This display of size not only intimidated Sursa but also affirmed Hanuman's strength and divine nature, reinforcing the theme of overcoming obstacles through sheer power.

Lord Vishnu, in his Vamana avatar, grew to a colossal size to measure the three worlds in three steps, demonstrating Mahima and showcasing his authority over the universe.

#### **Garima**

Ability to become infinitely heavy.

Hanuman tested Bhima's strength by transforming into an old monkey and lying across the path. When Bhima attempted to move Hanuman’s tail, he found it immovable. This incident taught Bhima a lesson in humility and respect, showcasing how Garima can be used to challenge pride and ego.

Angat when going to Ravana’s court challenged the warriors in his court to move his feet but no one was able to do so because Angat used garima siddhi.

Bhima, using Garima, could make his presence so heavy that it instilled fear in his adversaries.

#### **Laghima**

Ability to become weightless.

Hanuman demonstrated Laghima when he concealed himself in the leaves of an Ashoka tree in Lanka, avoiding detection by Ravana’s guards. This ability symbolizes the power of discretion and evasion, emphasizing the importance of strategic thinking in perilous situations.

It is said that through meditation and yoga, Sage Patanjali attained Laghima, allowing him to float during deep states of meditation.

#### **Prapti**

Power to be omnipresent.

While searching for Mata Sita, Hanuman employed Prapti to communicate with animals and birds, gathering essential information about her location. This Siddhi illustrates the interconnectedness of all beings and the importance of understanding one’s surroundings in pursuit of goals.

#### **Prakambya**

Ability to achieve whatever one desires.

Hanuman's eternal youth and his ability to fly are attributed to Prakamaya. This Siddhi highlights the potential for limitless existence and the ability to perform extraordinary acts, symbolizing the boundless nature of divine energy.

In various tales, he granted boons to his devotees that allowed them to fulfill their deepest desires, showcasing Prakamaya through his divine intervention.

#### **Ishitva**

Authority of absolute lordship.

Hanuman led the monkey army with great authority and respect, utilizing Ishitva to inspire loyalty and cooperation among his allies. This Siddhi represents the qualities of leadership and the responsibility that comes with power, emphasizing the importance of guiding others towards a righteous path.

Lord Krishna, in the Mahabharata, demonstrated Ishitva when he managed the Kurukshetra War, influencing both allies and enemies with his divine counsel and charisma, showcasing his leadership and command over the situation.

#### **Vashitva**

Power to conquer everything.

Hanuman’s ability to remain focused and composed, even in the face of adversity, is attributed to Vasitva. This Siddhi embodies self-discipline and the power to transcend desires, highlighting the journey towards inner peace and spiritual fulfillment.

Sage Durvasa, known for his intense discipline, could control his emotions and desires, and through Vashitva, he could invoke blessings or curses at will, illustrating mastery over both himself and his environment.

### Divine Qualities

Maa Siddhidatri is depicted as a radiant goddess seated on a lotus, embodying grace and strength. She has four arms, holding a conch shell, chakra, gada, and lotus, symbolizing her mastery over creation, preservation, and destruction. Her divine presence represents the union of masculine and feminine energies, emphasizing balance and spiritual perfection.

* **Four Divine Arms**: Maa Siddhidatri is depicted with four arms, each holding significant symbols:
    
    * **Conch Shell (Shankh)**: Represents the sacred sound of "Om," embodying the essence of creation and the call to spiritual awakening.
        
    * **Chakra**: Symbolizes the cycle of life and the divine protection that guides devotees away from negativity.
        
    * **Gada (Mace)**: Represents strength and power, showcasing her ability to destroy ignorance and evil.
        
    * **Lotus (Padma)**: Signifies purity and spiritual enlightenment, reminding devotees of the potential for growth and transcendence even in challenging conditions.
        
* **Siddhis**: As the goddess of accomplishment, Maa Siddhidatri is revered for granting siddhis (supernatural powers) to her devotees. Her grace empowers individuals to achieve their goals and attain spiritual mastery.
    
* **Unity of Energies**: Maa Siddhidatri is intricately connected to the divine union of masculine and feminine energies, symbolized by her association with Ardhanarishvara (the composite form of Shiva and Shakti). This quality emphasizes balance and harmony in all aspects of life.
    

### Lessons to learn

* The representation of Maa Siddhidatri as part of the Ardhanarishvara highlights the significance of balancing divine feminine and masculine energies. Embracing both aspects within ourselves can lead to harmony in life, helping us navigate challenges with greater resilience and understanding.
    
* This day emphasizes the importance of self-realization and mastery over one's thoughts and actions. Just as Maa Siddhidatri grants the eight siddhis, we are reminded that true strength and accomplishment come from within.
    
* Maa Siddhidatri’s blessings remind us that devotion and faith can lead to profound transformation
    

To explain a bit clearly, we need to learn the significance of the balance of the stillness(Shiva) and the energy(Shakti) within us. The fight needs to be calm inside first, to reflect it outside, remember the sun has to burn itself first, then provide the energy and light to others.

## Conclusion

As we conclude the celebration of Navratri and honor Maa Siddhidatri, we are reminded of the transformative power of spiritual mastery and inner strength. Her divine grace inspires us to pursue our highest potential, guiding us on our journey of self-discovery and empowerment. May we carry the lessons of balance, resilience, and devotion into our lives, allowing the blessings of Maa Siddhidatri to illuminate our paths and help us transcend limitations. Embrace the light within, and let it guide you toward fulfillment and harmony.

Remember it is just the end of Navratri, the actual fight starts now which is within, to improve one’s inner turmoil, evil thoughts, and deeds from the past. The day you realize that you have a purpose in life beyond the materialistic world, you achieve spiritual satisfaction, and that itself is liberation.

This sums up all the forms of Shakti worshipped culturally in the nine days of Navratri. Though these are not only the 9 forms of Maa Durga, there are almost infinite forms of Shakti.

Thanks for reading Mythology to Meaning! This post is public so feel free to share it.

### Future Plans

In the upcoming weeks, I will be writing the essence of Mahisasur Mardini Stotram, there are 21 shlokas. The perfect number as the days left before Diwali, is the number of days it takes to reach from Sri-Lanka to Ayodhya.

So, tomorrow is Dusherra, there will be a post on the importance of Dusherra along with the 1st shloka of Mahisasur Mardini Stotram.

In the upcoming months, I will try to explore Hindu mythology more deeply with its meaning and along the way will try to explain it in words, making the knowledge into actually usable insights.

### Closing thoughts

These are just my thoughts over the past few days, nine days, I am really happy that I was able to write 9 articles for 9 days straight and also publish around the same time in the evening of each day. This not only helped me get out of my negative thoughts but filled me with positivity to continue this writing journey.
