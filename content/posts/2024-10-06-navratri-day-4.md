### Mythological Story

At the center of the Sun, Goddess Kushmanda embodies its power, serving as the source of all life and energy. She possesses the ability to restore cosmic balance through the sun’s rays, representing the essence of Shakti. Meanwhile, two asuras, Mali and Sumali—sons of the warrior Sukesh—performed an intense tapas to win Lord Shiva’s favor. Their meditation emitted such a glow that Suryadev, curious, descended to Earth to investigate.

Ignoring celestial laws, Suryadev approached the glowing brothers, inadvertently causing their destruction by turning them to ashes. Furious, Shiva hurled his Trishul at Suryadev, plunging the universe into darkness that revealed the stars to the naked eye. This chaos broke the balance of gravity, prompting Rishi Kashyapa to curse Shiva, declaring he would also lose a son. Seeking redemption, Shiva urged Parvati to help restore Suryadev.

Sukesh and Rishi Kashyapa arrived, with Sukesh in tears and Rishi Kashyapa furious. After consulting Parvati, who instructed them to fill one pot with their blood, they magically filled another with Amrit. She asked Rishi Kashyapa to pour both into Suryadev, promising to bear a great child in return. Parvati then gifted Devavati an egg, which hatched into demonic offspring. Despite this, she earned the name Kushmanda for her virtuous actions, and Suryadev welcomed her into Suryalok, where her brilliance was essential for guiding the Sun and illuminating the universe.

### Anahata / Heart Chakra

The heart chakra, known as **Anāhata** in Sanskrit, is the fourth chakra in the traditional chakra system. Located at the center of the chest, it serves as the bridge between the lower and upper chakras, integrating our physical, emotional, and spiritual aspects.

> Ana → Not , un-
> 
> Hata → Struck, Beat, Defeated
> 
> Anahata → Unstruck, unbeated, undefeated

Feel strong, your body will be defeated, but your heart/soul will remain undefeated even after you die.

Hear Chakra is the center of love, compassion, and emotional balance. A balanced heart chakra allows for unconditional love towards oneself and others. It develops forgiveness, empathy, and the ability to connect deeply with others.

Healing other chakra might be very specific to the energy they provide, like desires, speech, intuition, etc. But for heart chakra, there is no specific thing attached, the only thing that will balance hear chakra has to be love, and love can’t be explained in a certain way. It will be different for each individual, if you want to balance your heart chakra, you need to heal it, healing not only refers to removing the negative emotions in or self, but also accepting the fact that negative things can exist and they might come to you as well, there is nothing wrong in the way things happen.

So, heart chakra is really special among all the chakra, without the balance of heart chakra, developing or balancing other chakras won’t uplift the spiritual process above a certain point.

An imbalanced heart chakra can manifest as emotional issues like Feelings of isolation, grief, or anger, heart problems, respiratory issues, or tension in the chest, struggles with intimacy, trust, or connection.

Maa Kushmanda embodies unconditional love, promoting self-love and compassion towards others, essential for a balanced heart chakra. Her energy fosters emotional stability, allowing us to navigate joy and sorrow more gracefully, which is vital for the development of the heart chakra.

### Lessons to learn

* Prioritize healing your spiritual thoughts and emotions to overcome negativity and make room for enlightenment.
    
* Recognize the importance of nurturing and balance in your life, as exemplified by Goddess Kushmanda, who brings forth life and harmony.
    
* Understand that healing involves both releasing negative emotions and accepting the existence of challenges, allowing for personal growth.
