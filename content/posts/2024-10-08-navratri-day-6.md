## Navratri Day 6

Day six of Navratri marks an important day in transcending spiritual enlightenment and moving beyond the human/animal tendencies to have perceptions about self and the environment. The day brings crucial learning by defeating the inner demon and obtaining the power of intuition along with the discrimination of needs with wants.

Maa Katyayini is considered as the most powerful and fierce form of Maa Durga/Shakti/Parvati. It is a form that when ignited slays the evil thoughts and vanquishes the negative thoughts within.

This day is the celebration and acceptance of the victory of feminine power over evil. It is a testament for generations to realize the true power of feminine beauty and strength. Maa Katyayani embodies not only ferocity and strength but also compassion and wisdom, reminding us that the divine feminine is both nurturing and fierce. Her triumph over Mahishasura signifies the relentless spirit of women.

This day appears to be the complete opposite of the previous day, which celebrated the nurturing power of the mother—the true, selfless, and unconditional love she pours into her child. In contrast, today highlights the fierce form of the mother. This teaches us that a mother can embody both love and fierceness when it comes to protecting her children.

### Quote for day 6

> "To describe my mother would be to write about a hurricane in its perfect power."
> 
> **— Maya Angelou**

Yes, if a mother can show unconditional love for her child, she can ignite her fierce form for the welfare of her child as well. Her love is not just a gentle breeze; it can transform into a tempest when her child's safety is at stake. This duality teaches us that true strength lies in the ability to nurture with tenderness and protect with unwavering ferocity. A mother's heart is a balance of compassion and fierce determination, embodying the powerful force of love that shapes and defends her children.

Love is important, but if it can’t do anything to save the person/soul for whom we care, is of no use, that won’t be love, that would be selfish greed. True unconditional love is the one that on the brink of death and life one would fight against death to save it.

Another way to put it would be “Kindness should not be a weakness in love: when the time comes, we need to put aside kindness, out of ignorance, and accept and try to erode the darkness residing within us.

## Maa Katyayani

Maa Katyayani, worshipped on the sixth day of Navratri, symbolizes the fierce energy needed to conquer internal demons, represented by Mahishasura. Her story highlights the transformative journey of self-awareness and inner battle against one's own karmas. She is renowned in the form of **Mahisasur Mardini** (the killer of Mahisasur demon), which is her fierce form with 18 hands riding on a lion and defeating the demon king Mahisasur.

## Conclusion

So, this wraps day 6, we have completed the initial and middle 3 days of Navratri, the only last 3 forms of Maa Durga are to be explored in this Navratri. From the sixth day, the message from Maa Katyayani Devi is to liberate oneself from false perceptions about him/her and to fight for righteousness. Kindness should not be a weakness in one’s love, is the best line I can write from this day.

In the upcoming days, we will explore more about each form of the goddess Shakti. We will delve into the powers and significance of each day in this festival.

Let’s enjoy the beautiful festival with the buzzing and divine energy around. Let’s remove negativity and spread positivity among us, and then the people around us. Let’s celebrate spiritual empowerment with a whole heart in the atmosphere buzzing with dance and music.
