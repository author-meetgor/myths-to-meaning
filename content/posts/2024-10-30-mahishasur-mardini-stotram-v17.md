This line beautifully composes the word to praise the goddess as well as convey the message of her power and divines.

The verse also emphasises her son, Kartikeya, who is the protector an warrior for the Gods, and has won over the demon Taraka who challenged the throne of the King of Gods. This verse depicts the qualities of the Goddess in her son as well.
