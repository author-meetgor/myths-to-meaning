## Shiv Tandav Stotram

The [Shiv Tandav Stotram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiva_Tandava_Stotra) is a powerful hymn dedicated to Lord Shiva, celebrating his cosmic dance, the Tandava. It is suspected to be composed by Ravana (not proven though), and it expresses awe for Shiva’s divine qualities, strength, and the profound energy of his dance, which symbolizes creation, preservation, and destruction. The storm serves as a prayer for spiritual awakening, invoking blessings of purity, power, and auspiciousness.

There are a total of [17 verses](https://hindi.webdunia.com/aarti-chalisa/shiv-tandav-stotram-114100100059_1.html) in the stotram. We will be exploring each verse separately and understanding its interpretation literally, mythologically as well as spiritually.

However, people might call it a destructive act but as with anything in the world, it depends on how you perceive it. If you take it positively it is a great source of inspiration and a heartful praise sung by the author (whoever it may be).

## Mythological Meaning

* **Jata** (Matted Hair) In Hindu mythology, Lord Shiva is often depicted as a yogi, emphasizing the importance of meditation and inner peace. Shiva's matted locks symbolize his ascetic nature and detachment from worldly life.
    
* **Ganga** (Flowing Water): The purifying stream of water represents the sacred river Ganga, which is believed to flow from Shiva's hair. It symbolizes purity, cleansing, and the flow of divine grace. Ganga is revered as a goddess in her own right, embodying the life-giving and purifying qualities of water. It shows how much power and humility are required in holding the sacred stream of Ganga whose force is impossible to withstand for mother earth.
    
* **Tandava** (Fierce and passionate dance): Tandava is a vigorous dance that signifies creation, preservation, and destruction—key aspects of the cosmic cycle. This dance is not just physical; it reflects the emotional and spiritual aspects of life, portraying Shiva as the ultimate force of nature and transformation. The fierce nature of the dance indicates Shiva’s role as a destroyer of ignorance and illusion, paving the way for new creation.
