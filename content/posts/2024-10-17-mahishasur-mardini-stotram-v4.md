## Spiritual Meaning

* **Shattering Ignorance like Maa Durga shattered enemy of elephants**: The shattering of enemy elephants and demons symbolizes the destruction of ignorance and negativity in one’s life. Just as Goddess Durga defeats formidable foes, we need to confront and overcome our own internal obstacles and misconceptions, paving the way for spiritual enlightenment.
    
* **Empowerment Through Action**: The verse emphasizes the power of taking decisive action against adversaries, both external and internal. By invoking the image of the Goddess wielding her strength to vanquish her enemies, it inspires us to embrace our capabilities and assertiveness in overcoming life’s challenges.
    
* **Divine Protection and Guidance**: The depiction of the Goddess as the ruler of beasts and a punisher of foes highlights her role as a powerful protector. Just as Maa Durga commands the lion, the king of all animals, we too must set aside our egos and self-importance. Regardless of our status or reputation, we should recognize the divine presence within us, guiding us toward enlightenment and liberation.
